Hey Alfie,

Good catching up earlier! Here is the F/E tech test to be completed for Raph at SimpleFi. Iâ€™ll send the BC one for your own interest in a separate email just to minimise confusion:

You need to build a Button component using react typescript and styled-components.

The button should accepts as props:
type, action, text, disabled

This button should have different styling (color, border) depending on the type passed (primary, secondary, danger).

Text is just the button content, action is the action to be executed on click.

Disabled is a bool that should disable the button.

On hover the button should also show some changes.

Let me know how it goes, you can send me the zip via email or share the GitHub link

Best,

Jack
